### Prerequisites

Vagrant-vbguest is a Vagrant plugin which automatically installs the host's VirtualBox Guest Additions on the guest system.
To successfuly run the Vagrantfile, the plugin must be installed first.

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

To update your plugins after a Vagrant upgrade, you can execute the following command.
```
vagrant plugin update vagrant-vbguest
```

If an update doesnâ€™t resolve the problem or something has corrupted your current installation, you can repair the plugin.
```
vagrant plugin repair vagrant-vbguest
```
